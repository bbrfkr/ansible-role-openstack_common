## Retest
This role is tested by serverspec, then its test codes are included in repository. Users can retest this role by using the test codes. To retest this role, follow the steps described below.

1. Prepare 2 targets (Here, targets ip are X.X.X.X, Y.Y.Y.Y)
2. Install serverspec in local machine
3. Modify spec/inventory.yml
```
---
- conn_name: target15  # never change!
  conn_host: X.X.X.X   # target ip
  conn_port: 22        # target's ssh port
  conn_user: vagrant   # user to connect
  conn_pass: vagrant   # password of user
  conn_idkey:          # path of identity key 
                       # (absolute path or relative path from the location of Rakefile)
  sudo_pass:           # sudo password of user

- conn_name: target16  # never change!
  conn_host: Y.Y.Y.Y   # target ip
  conn_port: 22        # target's ssh port
  conn_user: vagrant   # user to connect
  conn_pass: vagrant   # password of user
  conn_idkey:          # path of identity key
                       # (absolute path or relative path from the location of Rakefile)
  sudo_pass:           # sudo password of user
```

4. Modify targets ips in any files of `spec` dir
```
$ sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.115/X.X.X.X/g' `find spec -type f`
$ sed -i 's/192\.168\.1\.116/Y.Y.Y.Y/g' `find spec -type f`
```

5. Modify address Z.Z.Z.Z/ZZ allowed to sync clock by chronyd service
```
$ sed -i 's@192\.168\.1\.0/25@Z.Z.Z.Z/ZZ@g' `find spec -type f`
```

6. Run `rake`
